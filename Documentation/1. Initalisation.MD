         Documentation for libasciigfx - 1. Initalisation

In libasciigfx like in all engines and graphic libraries
you need to import and load all important functions and files
the most important one is libasciigfx.h because there is entire code
and you will load it by typing at start of your code:

#include <(directory where you putted library)/libasciigfx.h>

and after that you need to make layers which you can make by simple command called graphics.initLayer
but before that that command you must define layer with Asciigfx graphics command. Here is example:


Asciigfx graphics(false, 80, 20, 2);

    // Initializes layers
  under name graphics  
graphics.initLayer(0);
    // make layer 0
graphics.initLayer(1);    // make layer 1


and on end always make sure to put graphics.renderFrame(); command to render elements.
